## Pertinent Questions
* What development environment is used for software?
* What happens if the cost to ignore compliance is lower than the cost to implement changes to reach compliance?

## Lessons Learned
* A business analyst is a job title with varying responsibilities at different companies. At DFL, they are more on the technical side, and have managerial duties,
maintain organized backlogs, hold Q&A groups, and determine user/customer needs and facilitate solutions to meet those needs.
* A team lead is an experienced developer. On any given day, developers may work on large projects, smaller prioritized items, and bugs.
* Software Architects make large scale decisions on matters such as scalability, flexibility, business conditions, market, and cost.
* Companies can be publicly or privately owned. Public ownership requires more reporting to stakeholders.
* Time is money, and sometimes paying fines can be more expedient than fixing the problem causing the fine.
* Most companies use Agile methodology. Agile is not a single thing, as there are many ways to do it.
* A user story is an important piece of work for developers that provides justification for development of features in a project.
These can be part of a larger feature or stand-alone features. The reasoning of a user story is very important to developers,
and the acceptance criteria is a checklist of when requirements are complete.

## Differences
* One difference we noted was the mention of Scrum as a poor development model for DFL's needs, and the advantage of Kanban in limiting backlogs of unfinished work.
  Scrum consists of two-week planned sprint cycles, but it is difficult to use in service industries, as it can be slow to react to major disruptions. The Kanban system
  that DFL switched to emphasizes completing all work before moving to a new project, but adapting to needs as they arise.

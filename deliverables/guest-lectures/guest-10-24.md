## Pertinent Questions

- What environment is used for software development?

## Lessons Learned

- Winsupply is the 2nd largest plumbing wholesaler in the U.S and 2nd largest company in Dayton.
    - WinSupply creates their own software for things like inventory and communication instead of buying OTS systems from someone else.
    - Their development teams do not specialize in only one platform such as Microsoft, Oracle, or IBM, etc.
    - Different teams at Winsupply use different frameworks of AGILE, such as Kanban and Scrum.
    - They sometimes work with other companies such as SDS for outsourcing of development when it is more profitable and the in-house team(s) have more important things to work on.
    - They have recently tried RFID warehousing, drone deliveries, and smart lockers.

- Pitfalls of AGILE:
    - Lack of Communication, Lack of Planning, and Business Process Change can cause a project to fail.
    - Employee burnout, scope creep, poor data strategies, and not managing the backlog properly can also cause a project to fail.

- AI and clouds are overhyped and not needed for everything.
  - Next year certain AIs may be smarter than the average human, but most current AIs have below-average IQs and many are compromised by advertising and bad data input.
  - Furthermore, cloud storage is expensive. If you're going to run an AI/LLM, you should maintain your own datacenter for it.

- Tech can change a lot over 10 years.
  - Sometimes early adoption is not the best policy. Many technologies such as the Metaverse have flopped.
  - What was trendy 10 years ago is inefficient and out-of-style.
  - What was trendy 20-30 years ago is all-but-forgotten.

## Differences from Cogan's lectures
- SQL is an important foundational skill that everyone working in software should know, even if they aren't specializing in databases. Vector databases and NoSQL are also important skills
  to have for those working with databases regularly.
- Software development teams should focus on product management over project management, because project management only deals with the current project while product management deals with
  developing the best products and maintaining them throughout their lifecycle.

# Guest Lecture Response

- **Guest Lecturer:** `Todd Irlbeck`
- **Company:** `Riverside Research`
- **Date:** `10 October 2024`

## Pertinent Questions

- Question 1: How frequently do you need to get feedback to see if things are going the right way?
- Question 2: Does it matter how things get done, as long as everyone agrees?
- Quetiion 3: What environment is used for software development?

## Lessons Learned

- Conway's law: separate groups will develop different ways of talking which could cause groups to have issues communicating.

- When the Agile Manifesto was written "agile" was supposed to be an adjective to describe how software development ought to be. It was meant to be a way to let developers have full control of how things are made. Many developers are frustrated with the prevalent use of "Agile" as a noun describing a system with inflexible rules.

- You can and probably should roll your own git to prevent giving your intellectual property to external companies.

- AI can be great to speed up code development and templates. Riverside has developed their own ChatGPT-style LLM for their own purposes.
  
- Government contractor companies get contracts for the government for a set amount of time. Riverside typically gets 1- to 2-year contracts.

- It is important to continuously learn new innovations. Solutions should be useful, usable, and used.

- You should always check your code daily. Riverside's SWAT uses many programming languages to adapt to their current needs.

- To manage stress and fatigue, you should work about 60% of 40 hours and have meetings and items fill the remaining time. If you can't reach the goal realistically, you may need to minimize the goal. Riverside goes in 2-week Scrum cycles and in about 5 days can have a product ready. They meet with their clients a lot to give updates and get feedback.

- There are different branching and merging strategies used by different companies. Mozilla and Git use different strategies, for example.
  
- A collection of tasks is a user story, a collection of user stories is an epic, and a collection of epics is a theme.

## Differences from Cogan's lectures

- Software developers' user stories are allegedly useless unless they are developing for themselves.

- Before agreeing to develop something for a client, you should see if an adequate off-the-shelf solution is already available for them to use first. You also need to identify "pain points" that need to be addressed, and you should focus on outcomes rather than how the methods you get there. You should all work towards a shared vision, but how you get there might change over time

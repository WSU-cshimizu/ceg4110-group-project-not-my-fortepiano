Riverside research
Software Applications Team (SWAT)
Agile software development
Todd Irlbeck, SWAT lead
mechanical(?) engineer
Riverside does a lot of research for the base -Jake
Conway's Law: form your language around the team you're working with
Manifesto for Agile Software Development
creators frustrated with "agile" being used as a noun to describe a system instead of an adjective to describe practices
Riverside formed in 1967 at Columbia University
non-profit, DOD contractor
advisory and support services
primary purpose is to serve government needs
SWAT:  team of highly talented, results-driven software professionals delivering valuable, desirable solutions at the speed of relevancy
together, leverage their experience in a multitude of languages, frameworks, off-the-shelf products
they use scrum
solution is useful, usable, and used.
software engineers, DevOps, UXers, system administration
use many languages, not stuck to one language.
develop applications within 5 days
youthful tempo, urgency vs complacency
software is an easy market to start your own company
01, strawberry, Q* (specific chatgpt models, not available without subscription)
Canvas
have 01 make Tetris in Python
Canvas is like an IDE in ChatGPT; can quickly switch languages
capture any references in a picture, have LLM document things
senior developers don't use AI out of pride
only one person in their group does C#
RR developed their own ChatGPT-style LLM and put in their own stuff

1- to 2-year contract
small business innovator research

Customer Problem
Design Thinking
Rapid Prototyping (cycle)

Customer Soluton
Agile Development (cycle)
Sustainment (cycle)

pain points where you can help customers
focus on the outcomes (why) over the solutions (how methods)
look to see if there's a OTS solution that will already fit their needs
only bother to develop something if an adequate solution isn't available
only 30% of products on the market get adopted
pointless to offer an app to places like Haiti where wireless service is sparce or non-existent
international security
offices in Boston, Manhattan, Dayton, DC
plasma science, electromagnetics, teraherz- all by software engineers
need security clearance
themes, epics, user stories, spikes
minimum viable product
UXers call it a Minimum Usable Product
rapid prototyping = lean startup
build, measure, learn
test on real data to be sure, instead of just test data
customers have a lot of money and want projects faster, sooner
rapid protyping:
one hour discovery session with customer, make sure we have a user
3 day workshop with users to determine everything of value
product backlog of user stories
user stories > system requirements
system requirements don't articulate wants well
5 days to develop product
2 day primer session with owner and users
explain things to them because they may not be familiar with the technology
epics
team will assign themselves to do the work
after-friday
Agile was supposed to empower the developers
1 hour meeting
1 hour architecture
government white list of approved systems; ATO or CTO
other companies may spend a month or a year just on architecture
always get feedback from customers throughout sprint cycles
customers often remember things they do when testing things
Space Force
dry run and demo of code at end of week with customers

need to have devops putting environment in place while rapid prototyping is going on

portals to databases
portals can easily become overcomplicated

feedback based on empirical evidence

different UIs have become a sustainment burden
want to streamline
reduce to a couple back ends
fast API, Flask

Todd's job is to get the team to an initial plan
coach customers on how to articulate what they need
he owns the LLM
nobody on the team reports to each other
all peers
empower team members instead of allowing group think

keep everything on internal network instead of Github
use Community Gitlab
no longer use Jenkins
Gitlab allows backlog refinement
some teams use Subversion(?)
other companies may stick with one language
need to protect their IP and data
systems engineering

get slides from Cogan

theme contains epics contain user stories contain tasks
plans are useless, but planning is indispensable -Ike
all work toward vision, but how we get their might change

big floppy disks still sitting around, but not being run

how to deal with fatigue and stress?
capacity planning: start at 40 hours, working about 60%
meetings, items; if they can't reach the goal realistically, they try to minimize the goal

branching strategy: don't have a good answer for how to branch and merge
check your code daily
git has their own branching stategy
Mozilla has a strategy
team-dependent management of merge conflicts
putting out req for internships in a couple weeks

# Guest Lecture Response

- **Guest Lecturer:** `Leland Vakarian`
- **Company:** `MITRE Corporation`
- **Date:** `7th November`

## Pertinent Questions

- Team notes can include how to do stuff so if you suddenly disappear, your team can still carry on without you
- Personal notes can include new/neat tools you've encountered and in a way that assumes you've never encountered the thing before because you will forget

## Lessons Learned

Kanban board is the only thing useful from agile

Test driven development can make sense for very complex problems

learning one tool will generally get you through every other tool of the same type because there are similarities

## Pertinent Questions

- What environment is used for software development?

## Lessons Learned

- Sofware engineering is about engineering correct software.
    - You have a set of requrements and deadlines

- Compaines operate differently
    - Teams can also opperate differently in the same company

- Many Types of companies:
    - Large vs small 
    - Startups vs well-established
    - Private sector vs Government
    - Non-profit vs. for rofit
    - Freelancing

- Software engineering involves dev ops
    - Plan
    - Create
    - Verify
    - Package
    - Release
    - Configure 
    - Monitor

- Tech can change a lot over 10 years.

## Differences from Cogan's lectures

Software engineering observations
Leland Vakarian
Senior Computer Scientist and SysAdmin @ MITRE
did undergrad with Cogan
non-profit corporation
BS CS in 2017
been in indrusty for 11 years
develop applications in C, Python, and C++
home lab video games with GDscript
MITRE runs 6 FFRDCs sponsored by US govt
works to bridge government and industry
split time between sofware engineering and system administration
AMD Superpod
software engineering is not simply writing good code
software engineering is engineering correct software.
usually a team sport
if going solo, you have to hold yourself accountable
SE strategies
iterative vs waterfall
agile (scrum, sprints) vs kanban
FDD vs TDD programming
feature driven vs test driven
test driven may seem backwards, but is better for standardizing and very complex systems
teams may operate differently in the same company
no team implements a paradigm the same way as another team
Agile has no real definition
don't be afraid to job hop early in career
large vs small companies
single vs multi-widget shop, consultancy vs research
start-ups vs well-established
private vs govt
non-profit vs for-profit
freelancing
govt has better benefits but lower pay
SE strategies aren't silver bullets. Your design can and will change.
Your project shouldn't be a pet. Don't get attached to anything. Only work with cattle.
Despte this, the SE cycle is typically the same
hardcorde, envrio variables, flags, config, template, DSL, bash,  back to hardcode
SE involves a lot of devops
plan, create, verify, package, release, configure, montitor, back to plan
devsecops adds security cycle in middle, more common in govt
you don't need to learn everything because you can't. Therre's too much.
(dendrogram) for everything you need to learn to be a full stack developer
what should i learn? as much as you can.
target scope of what you're trying to learn to what you want to do.
hardware person, infra person, backend dev, frontend dev, designer, product manager
certain skills are forever skills
Linux, HTTP, TCP/IP
terminal, shells, caching, concurrency, hashing, authenifcation, dev/test/prod, sql, various design patterns, CLI and gui, semver
if your company wants to train you, let them
don't be afraid to try different paradigms
code bootcamps teach you what to type but not why
college teaches you theory but not what to type
read 3 times, do 7 times
when you're learning, move fast, and make/break things. do it on your own time if you can't do it at work.
Admin Zen:
take good notes, both for yourself and your teammates
know your tools
backup 
communicate
invest in yourself. learn forever skills
this field is a lifelong-learning field. you don't know what you don't know.
diversify
money isn't everything
as always, keep it logically awesome!
microsoft teams
nhbc channel at mitre?
gira (sp?)
Leland takes notes in markdown, but confluence doesn't take markdown
keep notes on how to do things, so somebody can pick up where you left off
devlog for personal stuff, what you learned, new shell application, version control
Obsidian
markdown notes, can tag, build knowledge graphs
write notes as if you've never read them before
Zadelkasten(sp?)?
don't save passwords in notes
write down things that you will absolutely forget later
document things immediately for compliance
check nodes
SLURM
sometimes develop tools for users, more often manage roles and systems
SALT
research prototypes
prioritized list of features to build
Arbiter, they forked it and made a version that met their requirements
you have to maintain your projects if people are still using them
take OTS solutions as much as they can
MITRE isn't allowed to compete with prime contractors because they're non-profit
light reading list:
Unix Koans - fun parables about Unix and C
Gilded Rose Kata - excellent code refactoring exercises
Lobsters > Hacker News. invite-only posting, publicly readable
Works by Michael Lucas
excellent educational material. chapter books that teach you various technologies, and very well in my opinion. I can't speak for his non-fiction though.

## Pertinent Questions

- What environment is used for software development?

## Lessons Learned

- Team notes can include how to do stuff so if you suddenly disappear, your team can still carry on without you.
- Personal notes can include new/neat tools you've encountered and in a way that assumes you've never encountered the thing before because you will forget.

- Test-Driven Design may seem backwards compared to Feature-Driven Design, but it can be better for standardization and very complex systems.

- Learning one tool will generally get you through every other tool of the same type because there are similarities. You can't learn everything, but you should try to learn as many forever-skills as you can.

- SE strategies aren't silver bullets. Your design can and will change. Your project shouldn't be a pet. Don't get attached to anything. Only work with cattle. Despte this, the SE cycle is typically the same.
    - Hardcode
    - Environment Variables
    - Flags

- Software engineering is not simply writing good code. Software engineering is engineering correct software.

- Tech can change a lot over 10 years.
- Code bootcamps teach you what to type but not why.
- College teaches you theory but not what to type.

## Differences from Cogan's lectures
- Kanban board is the only thing useful from Agile.

# Group Retrospective

## What went well in the group...
* We chose a sufficiently simple project, so we were not constantly rushed to get stuff working.
* We were fairly flexible in working with each other.
* We got everything done. that we set out to do.

## What could have been better in the group...
* We could have decided a team lead at the start to have the final say.
* Communication was sometimes difficult since each week we only had one Discord meeting and two classes with everyone present.
* We probably could have distributed the tasks better.

## What went well in the class...
* The guest speakers were generally interesting.
* Cogan's lectures were generally interesting, even if we didn't speak up much.
* The in-class assignments were helpful to our project development. 

## What could have been better in the class...
* Due dates could have been clarified better.
* Having to use Github for the syllabus and course schedule instead of (also) having a PDF on Pilot is somewhat awkward.
* We should have had a better supply of markers and erasers for the whiteboards.
